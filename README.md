# Jamf Zero Touch - Jamf Setup Manager at Stanford University

## What does Jamf Setup Manager do?
This is an baseline app and configuration application
* invoked during Setup Assistant and automated device enrollment in Jamf
* with progress indicators and customization options like Stanford branding
* expediting the Mac setup process by ensuring core applications are installed even before one logs in to Mac for the first time
