# Jamf Zero Touch - Jamf Setup Manager at Stanford University
This details Stanford University's implementation of Setup Manager for Mac.

## What does Jamf Setup Manager do?
In short, Stanford University uses Jamf's Setup Manager app to prepare Mac's consistently and quickly with minimal to no IT interaction.

This app...
* runs during Setup Assistant -- i.e. as part of automated device enrollment of Stanford-owned Mac's into Jamf
* displays progress indicators and offers customization options like Stanford branding
* expedites the Mac setup process by ensuring core applications are installed even before one logs in to Mac for the first time
